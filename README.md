### Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and visualization of the Nashville AirBnB dataset to gain valuable insights and create a better understanding of the AirBnB ecosystem in Nashville, Tennessee for all stakeholders involved. 

### Dataset
The data for this project was obtained from the [Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). The data was extracted in separate csv files used individually and also merged into one final file used in this project. The dataset supports both time-based data analytics as well as data visualizations. The Listings dataset contained the summary information and metrics for the Airbnb listings in Nashville and collected several key information about the Airbnb ecosystem in Nashville, Tennessee such as the unique listing ID, Host Id, Listings Owned by Hosts, Yearly Availability, among others. The Reviews dataset contained summary review data by the listing ID of the Nashvile Airbnb rentals and spanned about 15 years from April 2009 until March 2024. 

### Conclusions and Insights
**For Renters**:
- There are 8951 unique rental properties in the Nashville Airbnb ecosystem and 90% of these Nashville Airbnb listings are such that the customers (renters) get the entire homes or apartments to themselves. This makes Nashville Airnbnb rentals desirable for customers who enjoy their personal space and prefer little or no shared spaces with others while patronizing a rental property.
  
-  In Nashville, TN, Airbnb rental prices could be as low as 19 dollars and as high as 4163 dollars, with a right-skewed distribution. Averagely, the nightly price of an Airbnb rental listing is 197 dollars, while its median pricing point is around 158 dollars. Also, potential renters need to know that the listings in Nashville are a bit pricey as only 15% of all rentals have a nightly rate below 100 dollars, 33% of all rentals have a nightly rate below 150 dollars and 48 % of all rentals have a nightly rate below 200 dollars. This indicates that roughly 67% and 50% of Nashville Rentals are priced above the median and average rental prices respectively. Furthermore, 28% of Nashville Airbnb rentals are above 1000 dollars nightly to be secured.

- 98% of the listings provide short-term stays while just 2% of listings provide long-term stays. This high percentage indicates that the Airbnb ecosystem in Nashville primarily provides listings for short-term/temporary lodging rather than long-term rentals. Also, the average minimum nights requirement is 6 nights, confirming the prevalence of short-term rental listings.
